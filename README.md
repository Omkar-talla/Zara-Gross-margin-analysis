Zara needed to optimize their product mix and pricing strategy by understanding:

Which product categories deliver the highest gross margins?
How does pricing strategy impact profitability across different SKUs?
What patterns exist between quantity sold and revenue efficiency?
How can strategic pricing adjustments boost overall gross margin?
